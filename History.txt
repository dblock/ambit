* Additional documentation on side effects and rewinding.

* Fixed Ambit::trace and Ambit::untrace to work as described in the docs.
  This breaks the (undocumented) ability to turn on tracing
  generator-by-generator, but buys the ability to trace operation of the
  anonymous generator used by Ambit::choose.

=== 0.10.1 / 2011-04-26

* Updated repo path -- no functional change.

=== 0.10 / 2011-04-26

* Add Ambit::unmark! and Ambit::unmark_all!, which can be used to undo the
  effects of the Ambit::mark operation -- see "Marking and Cutting" in
  README for details.

* Add Ambit::trace and Ambit::untrace to turn on or off tracing of Ambit
  operations to STDERR.  In Ambit test cases, check for the environment
  variable AMBIT_TRACE, and turn on tracing during execution of tests if it
  is set.

=== 0.9.1 / 2011-04-26
